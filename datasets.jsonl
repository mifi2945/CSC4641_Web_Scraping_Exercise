All telescopes share the same deflection mechanism, but each has its own start and stop microchannel plate (MCP) and its own solid-state detector (SSD). Much of the data returned by CHEMS is separated by telescope. The deflection plate power supply (DPPS) has 32 different voltages that can be applied across the deflection plates. For any single DPPS step, the electrostatic analyzer only transmits incoming ions within a narrow range of energy per charge (a 3% pass band). The CHEMS calibrated data set includes the Pulse Height Analysis (PHA) data collected during the Saturn tour. CHEMS PHA provides a list of individually detected particles, with specific detection parameters for each event, including TOF, energy deposited in the SSD, and telescope number. The energy per charge data for six ion species (H+, He+, H2+, He++, O++, W+)  are presented in two forms. (The W+ water ion group includes O+, OH+, H20+ and H30+). One form is a set of tables which are of variable length and use a comma to separate various fields, and the other is a PDF file containing the energy per charge spectrograms and are based on CHEMS PHA data.

The time associated with each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the beginning of the scan. During data gaps where complete 4-second spectra are missing, no entries exist in the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any other way. When one or more channels are missing within a scan, the missing measurements are zero-filled. Data are edited but not calibrated. The data numbers in this data set can be plotted in raw form for event searches and simple trend analysis since they are roughly proportional to the log of the electric field strength.
