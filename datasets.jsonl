This data set includes uncalibrated values for each energy channel for the LEMMS sensor for all times during the mission including the Earth flyby, the Jupiter flyby, interplanetary cruise, and the entire Saturn tour.  Data are presented in a set of tables which are of variable length and use a comma to separate various fields.  This data set is intended to be the most comprehensive and complete data set included in the Cassini MIMI LEMMS archive.  A browse data set is included with Key Parameter data that is calibrated using the algorithms provided in the Calibration volume. In addition, a series of images are provided with the KP browse data that displays the KP data which can lead the user to the particular times of interest. This data set should be among the first used by a user of any of the MIMI LEMMS archive as it will lead one to information required to search for more detailed or highly specialized features in the original data.", "tags": ["cassini-huygens", "earth", "jupiter", "saturn"], "resource_links": [], "landing_page": "https://pds.nasa.gov/ds-view/pds/viewDataset.jsp?dsid=CO-E%2FJ%2FS%2FSW-MIMI-2-LEMMS-UNCALIB-V1.1", "text_sources": ["https://data.nasa.gov/dataset", "https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/cassini-e-j-s-sw-mimi-lemms-sensor-uncalibrated-data-v1-1-4c258"]}
