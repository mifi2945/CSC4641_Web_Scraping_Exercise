# How to Run


# Assumptions
There were a few unclear instructions within the directions given on Canvas. Some of these are now assumptions:

1. The links under "Data and Resources" don't actually have to be visited/downloaded; they just need to be added to the list in the jsonl
2. The "landing_page" is just the landing page url in "Additional Info"
3. The "text_sources" are just all visited links where the scraper looked and stored data from


# Issues
A big big issue was that even during initial testing with getting a request just to the listing page, the requests would consistently time-out, making it near impossible to test or collect any data.
